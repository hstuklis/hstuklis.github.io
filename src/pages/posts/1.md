# Welcome to my Homepage

Published on: 2025-11-17

Hi, my name's Henry. Professionally I'm a [data/software dev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-stuklis/) and coffee addict. In my spare time I'm a hobby coder and avid gamer.

I'm sick of having my browser manage my bookmarks across different systems and am certain I can present them in a much richer visual manner with enhanced categorisation.

So welcome welcome welcome, to my homepage. Feel free to stop by and make use (it'll mostly just be me let's be honest). I plan on making a few blog posts every now and then when I have something interesting to share.
